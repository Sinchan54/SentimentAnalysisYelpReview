# SentimentAnalysisYelpReview

This is a simple AI solution for classifiying the sentiment of a text. A text embedding with a Feed forward Neural Netwrok is used to perform the classification job. The training parameters are sub-optimal with respect to performance but will do its job as a starter.

The Yelp Review dataset is an opensource dataset and can be easily available. In case you have trouble finding the dataset you can contact me: bhattacharyasinchan@gmail.com
